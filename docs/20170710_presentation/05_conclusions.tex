\section{Conclusions}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigation was analyzed and applied to youBot.    
	\item The task contains mapping, localization, path planning, motion execution.
	\item Mapping was realized using gmapping, which requires laser scans and correct transforms.
	\item Localization was achieved using AMCL, which relies on a map, laser scans, transforms, and initial pose.
	\item DWA local planner was employed for path-planning.
	\item A node was created as a path executor that requests user input. 
	\item The robot was able to navigate around the lab by user input of a series of workspace.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User interface can be improved.
	\item The parameters can be retuned to improve the performace of robot. 
\end{itemize}
