\section{Conclusions}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ROS is a powerful and flexible framework for robot software development.
	\item Navigation was analyzed and applied to youBot.    
	\item The task contains mapping, localization, path planning, motion execution.
	\item Mapping and localization were realized in simulation, while all the subtasks were executed on youBot in experiments.
	\item The subtasks were successively carried out, such that navigation of robot was resolved. 
	\item The robot was able to navigate around the lab by user input of a series of workspace.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User interface can be improved.
	\item Enable the robot to detect barrier tapes.
	\item The parameters can be retuned to improve the performace of robot. 
\end{itemize}
