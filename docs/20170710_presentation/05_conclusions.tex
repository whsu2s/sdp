\section{Conclusions}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Navigation was analyzed and applied to youBot.    
	\item The task contains mapping, localization, path planning, motion execution.
	%\item Mapping was realized using gmapping, which requires laser scans and correct transforms.
	%\item Localization was achieved using AMCL, which relies on a map, laser scans, transforms, and initial pose.
	%\item DWA local planner was employed for path-planning.
	\item A node was created as a path executor that requests user input. 
	\item The robot was able to navigate around the lab by user input of a series of workspace.
    \item We faced some problems, most of them are solved.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User interface can be improved.
	\item The parameters can be tuned to improve the performance of robot.
    \item Barrier tape detection
