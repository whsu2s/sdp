Subtasks: 
1. Perception >> Sense environment >> get data 
2. Mapping >> Sonar map
3. Localization >> Particle filter or kalman filter
Problems or challenges in localization: 
i. Robot may get lost because many landmarks looks same.
ii. Errors in sensors.
iii. 
4. Path planning >> searches such as A* 
5. Obstacle avoidance >> With the help of sensors such as RGB-D camera,Laser scanners
challenges: What if there are static and dynamic obstacles.

6. Motion control >> Path 
Execution and acting 


===========================================
1.. Explain BNT  == Tasks from pdf (picture?)
2. Sub-tasks  and problems/challenges  :
	i. Perception: reading sensor data. such as camera, laser scanner etcetra
			challenges: sensor noise, calibration, barrier tape 
	ii. Localization: To know position of robot 
			challenges:
	iii. Mapping: Get map of environment 
			Challenges: exploration using remote control or autonomous
	iv. Path planning: plan path 
			Challenges: 
	v. Motion Control: simple definition
			Challenges: 
3. YouBot description: simple details from YouBot manual. 
4. ROS: diagram(client, masteR) , nodes, topics, messages 
5. Software modules/components: YouBot driver,   
6. Possible solutions for each module(E.g for localization: Particle filter, etcetra) 
7. Complexity of software

9. Workplan
